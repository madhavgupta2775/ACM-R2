I had started compcoding around 5-6 weeks ago, with no programming experience. Currently I have done everything in given in the ACM roadmap. 

Have given 13 real contests and around 10 virtual contests.

current rating on codeforces: 1298 (highest 1402)
current rating on codechef: 1589 (highest 1625)

Started studying intermediate/advanced algorithms after I became Specialist/Cyan on codeforces. 

no longer specialist (for now) :smiling_face_with_tear:

I have done basic number theory and am currently studying basic DP(till recursion and memoization) and plan to to start Graph theory (roadmap adivsed by senior)

All learning was done through websites(gfg, cpalgo etc.) (though I am studying DP from YouTube), and doubts if not cleared after around an hour or two of trying were posted in the CompCoding whatsapp group
