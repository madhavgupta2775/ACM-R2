# ACM-R2
This repository contains the details of my progress in **Competitive Coding** and **backend-development**.

## Competitive Coding

I had started compcoding around 5-6 weeks ago, with no programming experience. Currently I have done everything in given in the ACM roadmap. 

Have given 12 real contests and around 10 virtual contests.

Started studying intermediate/advanced algorithms on the suggestion of CompCoding group seniors after I became Specialist/Cyan on codeforces. 

no longer specialist (for now) :smiling_face_with_tear:

I have done basic number theory and am currently studying basic DP(till recursion and memoization) and plan to to start Graph theory (roadmap adivsed by senior)

All learining was done through websites(gfg, cpalgo etc.) (though I am studying DP from YouTube), and doubts if not cleared after around an hour or two of trying were posted in the CompCoding whatsapp group

## backend-development

I had started exploring backend development (backend and appdev both, but have done a lot less in appdev) after I realised that I had too much free time even after doing CompCoding

Know school level python and MySQL

I use Ubuntu for backend (did dual boot setup without erasing my data on Windows :sunglasses:)

Currently I am more than halfway done with the roadmap (more than 75% done with the djangogirls tutorial)

Though since the djangogirls tutorial used PythonAnywhere and SQLite I have currently used those only.
